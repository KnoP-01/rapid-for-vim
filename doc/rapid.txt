                        *rapid-Introduction*

**READ |rapid-FAQ| FIRST** if you want more than just syntax highlight and 
automatic indenting. It is a quick overview over the most important options and
mappings provided by Rapid for Vim.

Rapid for Vim (7.4 or later) is a collection of Vim scripts to help programing
ABB industrial robots. 

It provides
* syntax highlighting,
* indenting,
* concealing of structure values (e.g. MoveJ \* v2500...),
* support for commentary [vimscript #3695], matchit [vimscript #39],
  matchup [vimscript #5624] and endwise [vimscript #2386],
* mappings and settings to navigate through code in a backup folder structure,
* text objects for functions and
* completion of words from known or custom global files like EIO.cfg,
* mappings to insert a body of a new PROC, FUNC, TRAP et al based on user
  defined templates or hopefully sane defaults.

Note: Keep your files to be edited in one folder or in a regular robot
backup folder structure. Rapid for Vim modifies 'path' accordingly.
Note to Linux users: Keep your files to be edited on a FAT file system. 
Some features need the case insensitive file system to work properly.

                        *rapid-FAQ*
Short description:
------------------
Q: Since version 2.0.0 everything's weird. How so?  
A: Most optional features are enabled by default now.  

Q: I'm here to feed my kids, not to read. How do I get rid of stuff?  
A: Disable stuff in your |vimrc|, see |rapid-options| for details: >

    let g:rapidFormatComments = 0 " don't break comment lines automatically
    let g:rapidCommentIndent = 1 " indent comments starting in 1st column too
    let g:rapidShortenQFPath = 0 " don't shorten paths in quickfix
    let g:rapidAutoComment = 0 " don't continue comments with o, O or Enter
    let g:rapidSpaceIndent = 0 " don't change 'sts', 'sw', 'et' and 'sr'
    "let g:rapidConcealStructs = 0 " switch concealing off completely
    "let g:rapidConcealStructs = 1 " show structure values at cursorline, default
    let g:rapidConcealStructs = 2 " conceal all structure values

Q: Which keys get mapped to what? Will that override my own mappings?  
A: rapid-for-vim will not override existing mappings unless the corresponding
   option is explicitly set. To use different key bindings use the
   <Plug> mapping. Otherwise rapid-for-vim create the followin mappings: >

    <F2> Show all structure values
    <F3> Show structure values at cursorline
    <F4> Conceal all structure values
            Depend on g:rapidConcealStructs not existing or >=1.
            Override existing mapping with
        let g:rapidConcealStructKeyMap = 1

    gd Go to or show definition of variable or func, proc et al.
            Does override existing mappings and Vim's default.
            Disable override existing mapping and Vim's default with
        let g:rapidGoDefinitionKeyMap = 0

    <leader>u List all significant references of word under cursor.
            Override existing mapping with
        let g:rapidListUsageKeyMap = 1

    <leader>f List all def/deffct of the current file.
            Override existing mapping with
        let g:rapidListDefKeyMap = 1

    [[ Move around functions. Takes a count.
    ]] Move around functions. Takes a count.
    [] Move around functions. Takes a count.
    ][ Move around functions. Takes a count.
    [; Move around comments. Takes a count.
    ]; Move around comments. Takes a count.
            Does override existing mappings and overshadow Vim's default.
            Disable override existing mapping and Vim's default with
        let g:rapidMoveAroundKeyMap = 0

    if Inner function text object.
    af Around function text object.
    aF Around function text object including preceding comments.
            Depend on g:rapidMoveAroundKeyMap not existing or >=1.
            Override existing mapping with
        let g:rapidFunctionTextObject = 1

    ic Inner comment text object.
    ac Around comment text object.
            Depend on g:rapidMoveAroundKeyMap not existing or =1.
            Override existing mapping with
        let g:rapidCommentTextObject = 1

    <leader>n Inserts a new def/deffct.
            Override existing mapping with
        let g:rapidAutoFormKeyMap = 1

Q: When I switch syntax off I get false indentation sometimes?
A: Indentation partly depends on `syntax on` . If you have strings with ! or
   keywords in it Indentation may get confused without syntax on. It should
   do fine for the most part of your editing. See next question.

Q: Does rapid-for-vim provide a mapping for indenting the whole file?  
A: No, but you may put the following in your .vimrc or
   `~/.vim/after/ftplugin/rapid.vim`: >

    nnoremap <ANYKEY> mzgg=G`z 
or if you don't use syntax highlighting >
    nnoremap <ANYKEY> :syntax on<bar>normal mzgg=G`z<cr>:syntax off<cr>

Q: Scrolling feels sluggish. What can I do?  
A: Switch error highlighting off: >

    let g:rapidShowError = 0        " better performance

Q: Still sluggish!  
A: Switch syntax off or jump instead of scroll!  

Q: Where are the nice and informative messages?  
A: `:let g:knopVerbose=1` any time.

                        *rapid-options*

Set or reset options in your .vimrc. Except |g:rapidCommentIndent| and
|g:knopVerbose| changeing a rapid option during an editing session will 
have no effect.

Most features are enabled by default. Unless a mapping doesn't work as
expected, a mapping should be redefined or you want do get rid of some 
annoying feature there is no need to put any option in your .vimrc.
Exceptions may be |g:rapidCompleteCustom| and |g:rapidPathToBodyFiles|.

                        *rapid-highlighting*
                        *g:rapidShowError*
g:rapidShowError:
-----------------

Disable error highlighting:  >
    let g:rapidShowError = 0

If omitted or set to 1 a few syntax errors, mainly false usages of =, :=, <=
and >=, get highlighted. 
Note that this is not a syntax check.


Index: |rapid-index|
                        *g:rapidGroupName* 
g:rapidGroupName:
-----------------

Note: This option must be set before the colorscheme.

With this option reset rapid-for-vim does |hi-link| 
rapidBuildInFunction to |group-name| `Function`, 
rapidMovement to `Special` and
rapidSysvars to nothing: >
    let g:rapidGroupName = 0

With this option set rapid-for-vim does |hi-link| 
rapidBuildInFunction to |group-name| `BuildInFunction`, 
rapidMovement to `Movement` and 
rapidSysvars to `Sysvars`: >
    let g:rapidGroupName = 1

If omitted this option is automatically set if you use colorscheme
tortus or tortusless and reset for any other colorscheme. 

This is usefull if you want to set your own colors for Sysvars, Movement
and/or BuildInFunction:  >
    highlight Sysvars           guibg=Black     guifg=white
    highlight BuildInFunction   guibg=Black     guifg=#00d5d5
    highlight Movement          guibg=black     guifg=green

`rapidBuildInFunction`    contains Rapid functions.
`rapidSysvars`            nothing yet, maybe predefined Rapid constants someday.
`rapidMovement`           contains movement instructions like MoveJ, MoveJ .

If you like it colorful and dark background you may try the 
colorscheme tortus or tortusless which makes use of these groups:

==============================================================================
                        *rapid-indent*

Note: rapid-for-vim indentation works best with |syn-on|. 
You may map >
    nnoremap <ANYKEY> mzgg=G`z 
or if you don't use syntax highlighting >
    nnoremap <ANYKEY> :syntax on<bar>normal mzgg=G'z<cr>:syntax off<cr>
to indent the whole file with one key stroke. 

Index: |rapid-index|
                        *g:rapidSpaceIndent*
g:rapidSpaceIndent:
-------------------

Disables the modification of 'softtabstop', 'expandtab', 'shiftwidth' 
and 'shiftround':  >
    let g:rapidSpaceIndent = 0

If omitted or set to 1 the following Vim options get set:
    'softtabstop'   = 2
    'shiftwidth'    = 2
    'expandtab'
    'shiftround'

Keep in mind that space is rare and tabs look really awful on the teach
pendant.


Index: |rapid-index|
                        *g:rapidCommentIndent*
g:rapidCommentIndent:
---------------------

Enable indent of line comments which start in the first column: >
    let g:rapidCommentIndent = 1

This is default off for commented code like this: 
    WaitUntil di_blubb;
!    WaitUntil di_bla or di_blubb;
!    if di_bla then
!      do_bla;
!    endif
    do_blubb;

If omitted or set to 0 comments which start in the first column are not
indented.

This option may be changed any time and will take effect immediately.

                        *rapid-concealing*
                        *g:rapidConcealStructs* 
g:rapidConcealStructs:
----------------------

Set this option to 2 to have all structure values concealed on opening a file:  >
    let g:rapidConcealStructs = 2

Set this option to 0 to switch concealing off completely: >
   let g:rapidConcealStructs = 0

If omitted or set to 1 structure values get concealed except on cursorline
after opening a file: 
    MoveJ * v2500,...

Switch quickly between conceal level with |g:rapidConcealStructKeyMap|.
See also |conceal|.

==============================================================================
                        *rapid-jump-quickly*

Vim by itself provides a lot of nice features to get around quickly. Some of
those features depend on proper 'path' setting. Fortunatly rapid-for-vim takes
care about that and more for you.

For the best experience keep your files below `RAPID/` and `SYSPAR/` folder.

Note to unix/linux users: Keep your files on a filesystem which ingores case
(e.g. FAT) or some of the following features may not work correctly.

ftplugin/rapid.vim does set 'path', 'suffixes' and 'suffixesadd' to find files
within a regular ABB backup folder structure. This is not only usefull for
commands like |:find|, |gf|, |^Wf| and the like but also necessary for some of
the following features.

You may instruct rapid-for-vim not to change 'path' if you reset |g:rapidPath|.
'suffixes' and 'suffixesadd' get their values unconditionally. 

Index: |rapid-index|
                        *g:rapidGoDefinitionKeyMap*   *<Plug>RapidGoDef*
g:rapidGoDefinitionKeyMap:
--------------------------

Note: This mapping overshadows the default Vim command |gd|.

    `gd`: Jump to or shows variable or Proc/Func... declarations.

To force this mapping off and make Vims default available: >
    let g:rapidGoDefinitionKeyMap = 0

Alternativ <Plug> mapping: >
    augroup RapidGoDefMapping
    au!
    au FileType rapid nmap <silent><buffer> ANYKEY <Plug>RapidGoDef
    augroup END

A succesful search for a file local declaration jumps there right away. Get
back where you were with |CTRL-O|. A succesful search for a global declaration
opens the |quickfix-window|. 

Works best with `:syntax on` and both |g:rapidPath| omitted.


Index: |rapid-index|
                        *g:rapidListUsageKeyMap*  *<Plug>RapidListUse*
g:rapidListUsageKeyMap:
-----------------------

    `<leader>u`: List all references, outside of enum declarations and comments 
                 of the word under the cursor in the |quickfix-window|.

To force this mapping if `<leader>u` is already mapped: >
    let g:rapidListUsageKeyMap = 1

Index: |rapid-index|
                        *g:rapidMoveAroundKeyMap*
g:rapidMoveAroundKeyMap:
------------------------

Note: These mappings overshadow the default Vim commands 
|[[|, |]]|, |[]| and |][|!

[count]`[[`    Jumps backward to the next PROC/FUNC... [count] times. Works in
            |Normal|-, |Visual|- and |Operator-pending|-mode, see |operator|. 
            In Normal-mode it respects 'wrapscan'.

[count]`]]`    Like [[ but jumps forward to the next PROC/FUNC...

[count]`[]`    Like [[ but jumps backward to the next ENDPROC/ENDFUNC...

[count]`][`    Like [[ but jumps forward to the next ENDPROC/ENDFUNC...

[count]`[;`   Like [[ but jumps backward to the start of current or, if in
            between, previous comment.

[count]`];`   Like [[ but jumps forward to the end of the current or, if in
            between, next comment.

To force these mappings off and make Vims default available: >
    let g:rapidMoveAroundKeyMap = 0

Note that |g:rapidFunctionTextObject| and |g:rapidCommentTextObject| depend on
this feature.

                        *g:rapidShortenQFPath*
g:knopShortenQFPath:
--------------------

Note: g:rapidShortenQFPath is synonym for `g:knopShortenQFPath`.
Use the g:knop* variable!

Disable shortening of paths in quickfix-window, thus always show full paths: >
    let g:knopShortenQFPath = 0

If omitted or set to 1 paths longer than 40 characters in quickfix-window are
shortened with |pathshorten()|.

Use the g:knop* variable!

Where to open the |quickfix-window| the first time.

Open quickfix-window right hand side: >
    let g:knopRhsQuickfix = 1

Open quickfix-window left hand side: >
    let g:knopLhsQuickfix = 1

If you use |vim-qf|.vim (vimscript #5211) these options will not work

                        *g:rapidPath*
g:rapidPath:
------------

Disables the modification of 'path': >
    let g:rapidPath = 0

If omitted or set to 1 rapid-for-vim tries to set 'path' to the root
`.../KRC/**` of a kuka backup.

Note: Many features of rapid-for-vim depend on a proper 'path' setting.

Expected folder structure:

BACKINFO/
CS/
HOME/
RAPID/
    +-TASK*/
          +-PROGMOD/
          |-SYSMOD/
SYSPAR/

rapid-for-vim does looks 1 or 3 levels upward for a `BACKINFO/`, `CS`, 
`HOME`, `RAPID/` and `SYSPAR/` folders. If found those get added to 
'path' with ** appended See |starstar|.
In case you work with a .prg file, put your SYSPAR/ folder parallel to that
file.

                        *rapid-complete*  

Can't remember if the name of that signal was `diGrp1_Opn` or `diGripper1Open`?
No problem! Just insert `diG` and hit |i_CTRL-P| or |i_CTRL-N|. 

rapid-complete adds the `EIO.cfg` and `user.sys` files to 'complete' as {dict}.
You may add your own files, see |g:rapidCompleteCustom|.
The syntax file will also be added, so you can complete known Raid functions
and keywords.

                        *g:rapidCompleteStd*
g:rapidCompleteStd:
-------------------

Note that if you work below a path with special characters (one of `{}[]) in
it this feature may not work.

Disables the modification of 'complete': >
    let g:rapidCompleteStd = 0

If omitted or set to 1 rapid-for-vim will attempt to add the following files 
to 'complete' as {dict}. >
    RAPID/TASK[1-7]/SYSMOD/user.sys
    SYSPAR/EIO.cfg
    'runtimepath'/syntax/rapid.vim

For this feature to work you need to start your edit inside a backup-folder 
or have all files you need in the same directory as the current file.

Enable |g:rapidVerbose| to see what files are actually added.


Index: |rapid-index|
                        *g:rapidCompleteCustom*
g:rapidCompleteCustom:
----------------------

Note that if you work below a path with special characters (one of `{}[]) in
it this feature may not work.

Add custom files to 'complete': >
    let g:rapidCompleteCustom = [
      \'TASK1/PROGMOD/advR1_MainMod.mod',
      \'TASK1/SYSMOD/DAI_System_R1.sys', 
      \'TASK1/SYSMOD/DAI_IntertaskDefinitions.sys', 
      \'ApplSys/ROB1/BE_User.sys']

Note: Make sure to use forward slashes (`/`) as path separator, also on
Windows!

You should add the path relative to `RAPID/`. `HOME/`, `CS/` etc. Even if you 
put all the files you edit are in the same directory, they will be found. You 
may also add just a file name, However, in that case the file will only be 
found if present in the same directory as the current file. 

Enable |g:rapidVerbose| to see what files are actually added.

See also |rapid-complete|.

If omitted or set to 0 no custom files get added to complete.

                        *rapid-text-objects*  

rapid-for-vim text objects work similar as other Vim |text-objects|.
They can be used in |Visual|- and |Operator-pending|-mode, see |operator|. 

                  *g:rapidFunctionTextObject* *<Plug>RapidTxtObjInnerFunc*

g:rapidFunctionTextObject:
--------------------------

Note: These text objects depend on |g:rapidMoveAroundKeyMap| = 1 or omitted.

    [count]`if`: inner part of FUNC/PROC....
    [count]`af`: outer part of FUNC/PROC....
    [count]`aF`: outer part of FUNC/PROC... including, if present, one empty
            following line and directly preceding comments.

To force these text objects if `if`, `af` and/or `aF` is already mapped: >
    let g:rapidFunctionTextObject = 1

Since robotware 5.something or 6.something the robot safes *.cfg files with a
mix of <CR><NL> and <NL> line termitators. rapid-for-vim does automatically 
correct this unless: >

    let g:rapidFormatComments = 0

If omitted or set to 1 comments get wrapped at 'textwidth'. If 'textwidth' is
0 it's set to 78. You may also use |gq| to format comments.

                        *rapid-auto-form*

With rapid-for-vim you can quickly create a new PROC/FUNC... after your
liking. 

Type `<leader>n` anywhere in a *.mod, *.sys or *.prg file. You will get prompted
on some details for the new body. The last prompt is the name. The name prompt
is mandatory, all others may be typed quickly after `<leader>n`. Hit <esc> or
enter an empty string at any prompt to abort.

Example: `<leader>ngfb` will insert a body for a new global function of type
bool.
Mnemonic: New Global Function of type Bool

The |User| group |autocmd-event| `RapidAutoFormPost` will be triggered after the
insertion is finished and may be used for further customization: >
    augroup RapidAutoForm
    au!
    au User RapidAutoFormPost call MyAutoFormPostFunc()
    augroup END

Index: |rapid-index|
                        *g:rapidAutoFormKeyMap*
g:rapidAutoFormKeyMap:
----------------------

To force these mappings if `<leader>n` is already mapped: >
    let g:rapidAutoFormKeyMap = 1

This list may seem overwhelming, but those mappings are quite logical and can
be used to skip the first few promps. After <leader>n just continue like you
would answer the prompts for "[g]lobal or [l]ocal?", "[p]roc, [f]unc, [t]rap or
[r]ecord?" and "Datatype? [b]ool, [n]um, [d]num...".

Note: Mappings marked with * will have a little delay until they trigger.
