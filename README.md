# rapid-for-vim

**READ [FAQ][2] FIRST** if you want more than just syntax highlight and 
automatic indenting. It is a quick overview over the most important options and
mappings provided by Rapid for Vim. For more details see the [help][3] file.

## Introduction:

Rapid for [Vim][10] (7.4 or later) is a collection of Vim scripts to help
programing [ABB industrial robots][9]. 

It provides
* syntax highlighting,
* indenting,
* concealing of structure values (e.g. MoveJ \* v2500...),
* support for commentary [vimscript #3695][7], matchit [vimscript #39][8], 
  matchup [vimscript #5624][11] and endwise [vimscript #2386][12],
* mappings and settings to navigate through code in a backup folder structure,
* text objects for functions and
* completion of words from known or custom global files like EIO.cfg,
* mappings to insert a body of a new PROC, FUNC, TRAP et al based on user
  defined templates or hopefully sane defaults.

**Note:** Keep your files to be edited in one folder or in a regular robot
backup folder structure. Rapid for Vim modifies 'path' accordingly.
**Note to Linux users:** Keep your files to be edited on a FAT file system. 
Some features need the case insensitive file system to work properly.


## Installation:

### Installation with vim-plug:  ~  

Put this in your .vimrc:  >

    call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
      Plug 'KnoP-01/rapid-for-vim'
    call plug#end()
    syntax off                 " undo what plug#begin() did to syntax
    filetype plugin indent off " undo what plug#begin() did to filetype
    syntax on                  " syntax and filetype on in that order
    filetype plugin indent on  " syntax and filetype on in that order

For the first installation run: >

    :PlugInstall

Update every once in a while with: >

    :PlugUpdate

### Manual installation:  ~  

Extract the most recent [release][1] and copy the folders 
`/doc`, `/ftdetect`, `/ftplugin`, `/indent` and `/syntax` 
into your `~/.vim/` or `%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles\` directory. 
Overwrite rapid.\* files from older installation. 

Put the following in your .vimrc: >

    syntax on                  " syntax and filetype on in that order
    filetype plugin indent on  " syntax and filetype on in that order

You may have to run >

    :helptags ~/.vim/doc/

or >

    :helptags ~/vimfiles/doc/

to use the help within Vim after installation. >

    :help rapid


## FAQ

Q: Since version 2.0.0 everything's weird. How so?  
A: Most optional features are enabled by default now.  

Q: I'm here to feed my kids, not to read. How do I get rid of stuff?  
A: Disable stuff in your `vimrc`, see [rapid-options][6] for details: >

    let g:rapidFormatComments = 0 " don't break comment lines automatically
    let g:rapidCommentIndent = 1 " indent comments starting in 1st column too
    let g:rapidShortenQFPath = 0 " don't shorten paths in quickfix
    let g:rapidAutoComment = 0 " don't continue comments with o, O or Enter
    let g:rapidSpaceIndent = 0 " don't change 'sts', 'sw', 'et' and 'sr'
    "let g:rapidConcealStructs = 0 " switch concealing off completely
    "let g:rapidConcealStructs = 1 " show structure values at cursorline (default)
    let g:rapidConcealStructs = 2 " conceal all structure values

Q: Which keys get mapped to what? Will that override my own mappings?  
A: rapid-for-vim will not override existing mappings unless the corresponding
   option is explicitly set. To use different key bindings use the
   `<Plug>`mapping. Otherwise rapid-for-vim create the followin mappings: >

    <F2> Show all structure values
    <F3> Show structure values at cursorline
    <F4> Conceal all structure values
            Depend on g:rapidConcealStructs not existing or >=1.
            Override existing mapping with
        let g:rapidConcealStructKeyMap = 1

    gd Go to or show definition of variable or func, proc et al.
            Does override existing mappings and Vim's default.
            Disable override existing mapping and Vim's default with
        let g:rapidGoDefinitionKeyMap = 0

    <leader>u List all significant references of word under cursor.
            Override existing mapping with
        let g:rapidListUsageKeyMap = 1

    <leader>f List all def/deffct of the current file.
            Override existing mapping with
        let g:rapidListDefKeyMap = 1

    [[ Move around functions. Takes a count.
    ]] Move around functions. Takes a count.
    [] Move around functions. Takes a count.
    ][ Move around functions. Takes a count.
    [; Move around comments. Takes a count.
    ]; Move around comments. Takes a count.
            Does override existing mappings and overshadow Vim's default.
            Disable override existing mapping and Vim's default with
        let g:rapidMoveAroundKeyMap = 0

    if Inner function text object.
    af Around function text object.
    aF Around function text object including preceding comments.
            Depend on g:rapidMoveAroundKeyMap not existing or >=1.
            Override existing mapping with
        let g:rapidFunctionTextObject = 1

    ic Inner comment text object.
    ac Around comment text object.
            Depend on g:rapidMoveAroundKeyMap not existing or =1.
            Override existing mapping with
        let g:rapidCommentTextObject = 1

    <leader>n Inserts a new PROC/FUNC/TRAP/RECORD.
            Override existing mapping with
        let g:rapidAutoFormKeyMap = 1

Q: When I switch syntax off I get false indentation sometimes?
A: Indentation partly depends on `syntax on` . If you have strings with ! or
   keywords in it Indentation may get confused without syntax on. It should
   do fine for the most part of your editing. See next question.

Q: Does rapid-for-vim provide a mapping for indenting the whole file?  
A: No, but you may put the following in your .vimrc or
   ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/rapid.vim: >

    nnoremap <ANYKEY> mzgg=G`z 
or if you don't use syntax highlighting >

    nnoremap <ANYKEY> :syntax on<bar>normal mzgg=G`z<cr>:syntax off<cr>

Q: Scrolling feels sluggish. What can I do?  
A: Switch error highlighting off: >

    let g:rapidShowError = 0        " better performance

Q: Still sluggish!  
A: Switch syntax off or jump instead of scroll!  

Q: Where are the nice and informative messages?  
A: `:let g:knopVerbose=1` any time.
